# YouTube_Comments_Intersection
The intersection of specific YouTube channel commentators with some other channels (last n videos)

Allows finding the intersection of commentators between YouTube channels (extracts a specified number of comments for each channel from the latest n videos).

The benefit lies in the ability to approximately assess the intersection of audiences or compare the relative intersection with others.
